/*
Merge Strings Alternately (LC 1768)
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, 
starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end 
of the merged string.
Return the merged string.
SOLUTION IN C
